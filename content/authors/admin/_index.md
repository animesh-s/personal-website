I am a Research Engineer at Meta AI working on Generative AI research. I received my Master's degree from Purdue University in 2018 and Bachelor's degree from IIT Kharagpur in 2014. I work on large-scale machine learning algorithms for image generation, object recognition, retrieval and representation learning at the intersection of vision and language.
