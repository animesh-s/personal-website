Online advertising is one of the most effective ways for businesses of all sizes to expand their reach, find new cus- tomers, and diversify their revenue streams. Predicting whether a user clicks on an impression is a central problem in display advertising. Display advertising involves fea- tures regarding contexts (publishers) as well as users and ads (advertisers). This implies more complicated interac- tions between these features, which should be taken into consideration when clicks are predicted. However, tradi- tional approaches, such as linear models are weak in mod- eling these complicated interactions between context, users and ads. We propose three deep models, Multilayer Per- ceptron, Convolutional Neural Network and Autoencoded Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, and compare the results to the traditional models, Logistic Regression and Gradi- ent Boosted Decision Trees, prevalent in the industries. We also treat this classification problem as an Anomaly De- tection problem by varying the skewness ratio of the two classes. We were able to marginally beat the traditional models because of the reasons we discuss later.
